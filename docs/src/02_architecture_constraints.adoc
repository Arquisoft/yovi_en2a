== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical Constraints

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Web application must be implemented in TypeScript/JavaScript
|The frontend and external API are required to be developed using TypeScript/JavaScript as specified in the assignment.

|Bot logic must be implemented in Rust
|The game engine responsible for move suggestion and win detection must be developed as a separate Rust module.

|Communication between subsystems via JSON using YEN notation
|The web application and the Rust service must exchange data using JSON messages following the YEN game notation defined in the assignment.

|Service-oriented architecture
|The Rust module must expose its functionality through a web service interface callable by the web application.

|Use of Firebase as the database
|User data, match history, and statistics must be stored in Firebase, as chosen by the team.

|Deployment on a cloud platform
|The system must be publicly accessible. The backend services will be deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., Vercel, Railway, or Azure).

|Public external API for bots
|The system must expose a documented API allowing external bots to access game data and play matches.

|Browser-based execution
|The frontend must run in standard modern web browsers without requiring special installations.

=== Organizational Constraints

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Assignment requirements define core functionality
|The system must implement at least the classic version of Game Y with player-vs-machine mode and variable board size.

|Public deployment required
|The application must be accessible through the web as part of the evaluation criteria.

|Documentation must follow arc42
|Architecture documentation must comply with the arc42 structure provided by the course.

|Quality requirements for evaluation
|The project must include testing (unit, integration, and e2e), CI/CD, monitoring, and proper repository management.

|Team-based academic project
|Decisions must consider limited time, resources, and team size typical of a university assignment.
|===

---

=== Conventions and Standards

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Use of YEN notation for game state
|All game states exchanged between components must follow the defined YEN notation format.

|REST-style API with JSON
|All external and internal services will communicate using JSON over HTTP.

|Version control with Git
|All source code and documentation will be managed using a Git repository.

|Code quality and testing practices
|The project must include automated tests and follow agreed coding standards.

.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.
