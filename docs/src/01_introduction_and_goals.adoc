== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider.
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features,
* essential functional requirements,
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders.
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions.
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

| Quality Goal | Description

| Functional Suitability
| The system shall correctly implement the classic version of Game Y, including win-condition verification for any supported board size. All user-facing features (play game, select strategy, view statistics) and API operations shall behave according to the specified requirements.

| Performance Efficiency
| For a standard match, the system shall return a computer move or API response within 1 second under normal load. The architecture shall support at least 20 concurrent players without noticeable degradation in responsiveness.

| Reliability
| The system shall consistently determine correct game outcomes and suggested moves, with an error rate of less than 1% in win detection or AI move generation. User data and match history shall not be lost during normal operation.

| Usability
| First-time users shall be able to start and complete a game without external help. The web interface shall clearly display the board state, available actions, and game status. The learning time for basic gameplay should be less than 30 minutes.

| Maintainability
| The architecture shall allow new AI strategies, difficulty levels, or Game Y variants to be added without major refactoring. Clear module boundaries and documented interfaces shall enable developers to modify or extend functionality efficiently.

| Security
| User accounts and personal data shall be protected through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. API endpoints shall restrict access to authorized clients and prevent unauthorized manipulation of game or user data.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

| _Game Y rules_ | link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_(game)[Official Wiki - Game  Y] | _Inmutable statement that define de rules for playing the vanilla version of the game. Shall be followed._
| _Final users_ | There is no direct communication though social media or polls may be useful | _They will be the main enjoyers of the system, they shall communicate errors and tell thing they are not really keen on or improvements. The system shall be design expecting them to use it._
| _Server_ | ??? | It will include all of the different parts of the game dockerized allowing acccess to all users.
| _Google Workspace DDBB_ | Firebase| It is a no relational DDBB that will store all the persistent information regarding the users and the games.
