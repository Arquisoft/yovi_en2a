== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

The following table describes the technical interfaces and the channels used to link the system components and external entities.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Component / Channel |Description
|**User Device** |Computer, laptop, or mobile device used to access the system via a secure HTTPS connection.
|**Web Application (Frontend)** |Developed in TypeScript. Manages matches, communicates with the Rust module, and interacts with Firebase and the Bot API.
|**Rust Game Logic Module** |Component responsible for match outcomes and bot moves. Exposes a web service endpoint for the Frontend.
|**Firebase Database** |Cloud persistence layer for user information and statistics via Firebase SDK.
|**Public API for Bots** |Interface for external bots to interact with the system over HTTPS.
|**Deployment Platform (Azure)** |Cloud infrastructure hosting the Rust backend and WebApp, ensuring HTTPS and availability.

==== Mapping Input/Output to Channels

The following table maps the domain-specific inputs and outputs to their respective technical channels and protocols.

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Channel |Input |Output
|**HTTPS (Browser → WebApp)** |User moves, bot strategy selection, login registration info. |Board updates, results, statistics.
|**HTTP JSON/YEN (WebApp → Rust)** |Board state (YEN), active player, strategy. |Match outcome, bot move.
|**Firebase SDK (WebApp ↔ Firebase)** |User registration, results, statistics. |Data persistence and retrieval.
|**HTTPS (API → Bot)** |Board state (YEN), strategy parameters. |Bot move response.
